Open Media Rating System (OMRS)

Version 1.00 - 2024, Monday, November 11th at 09:37 pm PST

The Open Media Rating System (OMRS) is a free, libre, and open source, public domain alternative to the MPAA and ESRB rating systems. It was created due to the unfree and highly restrictive nature of the MPAA rating system and ESRB rating system, both of which require Trademark compliance with some very bad actors. By having a less restrictive rating system, it is hoped that it will be free, more effective, and more friendly.

The rating system will be federated by default (it is encouraged that federated sites (similar in nature to Mastodon) can rate content, and host ratings) ratings can be registered by special groups of federated sites. Due to the more open nature of this system, others can register ratings as well, even if they are not federated.

Media types (8 groups)

üïπÔ∏è VG - Video Game
üíæÔ∏è SO - Software/other
üéûÔ∏è FL - Film/movie
üñºÔ∏è SI - Still image/picture
üéµÔ∏è AU - Audio/music
üìîÔ∏è DO - Document/book/manual/text
üêΩÔ∏è OD - Odor/smell
‚ùìÔ∏è OT - Other/undefined

Note: Other/undefined is reserved for new media types that currently don't exist.

Minimum age ratings (8 groups)

‚úÖÔ∏è 0-3
‚úÖÔ∏è 3-6
‚òëÔ∏è 6-9
‚ö†Ô∏è 9-12
‚ö†Ô∏è 12-15
‚õîÔ∏è 15-18
üîûÔ∏è 18-21
üîûÔ∏è 21+

Note: age ratings are on a basis of maturity. People of different ages should be able to watch what they want, as long as they know what to repeat, what not to repeat, and what is morally good and/or bad, with the exception of gore and sex, which should be restricted to certain ages in most cases. TL;DR: viewer discretion is advised
